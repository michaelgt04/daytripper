# Daytripper

## Explore Around You

As a kid, I used to take day trips with my family regularly. We'd all pile into the car drive around
a little bit and stop at whatever looked fun or interesting! They're realy awesome memories and I'll
always remember the sense of adventure they gave me whenever we set off to explore.

This application seeks to give you that same experience no matter where you live. All you have to do
is type in the place you are, type in a radius of how far you're willing to travel and Daytripper will give you back a destination. If you don't like that destination, or you've already been there, you
have the option to switch out your destination for another. When you're done exploring your first
place, you can then have the app give you another so your adventure can go on!

You also have the flexibility to choose the type of journey you'd like to go on. I personally am all
about seeing a place through its food destinations, but users also have the option to go on an
educational trip, arts adventure or even head out into nature.

Go out, explore and enjoy!

## Technologies

- React

  This is a single page React application. This is to ensure a quick and responsive user interface
especially when switching destinations. I didn't want to have users endure repeated page reloads as
they tried to add additional destinations.

- Yelp API

  The user recieves recommendations for places to go using the Yelp API. This ensured that there are
a large number of destinations to choose from as well as a large geographical variety of places for
users to visit.

### Note:

This project was built during Launch Academy's Ship It Saturday during my cohort, during which I
reached an MVP. Additional features were added on afterwards.
